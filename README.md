Medical RAG System ‚Äì Key Development Points
üõ† Backend & API Development
Developed a Django REST API for structured medical knowledge retrieval, ensuring fast and scalable responses.

Integrated FAISS-based vector search for high-speed retrieval of relevant medical documents.

Designed an efficient PostgreSQL schema to store structured health records and knowledge graph data.

Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate access levels for patients, doctors, and administrators.

Developed ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load medical data from various sources into the system.

üîç AI & Semantic Search
Utilized FAISS for semantic retrieval, enabling quick and accurate medical query responses.

Implemented BM25 and TF-IDF models for keyword-based search, enhancing search flexibility.

Fine-tuned Qwen2-0.5B as the LLM for generating context-aware, reliable medical insights.

Used all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as the embedding model, ensuring efficient vector-based semantic search.

Designed a hybrid indexing system combining FAISS vector search and SQL relational queries for efficient data retrieval.

üìä Medical Query Processing & Knowledge Graphs
Integrated structured medical knowledge graphs to enhance AI-generated responses with factual accuracy.

Applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key medical terms from user queries.

Developed context-aware response generation, ensuring accurate and medically relevant answers.

Designed an explanation module to provide reference sources for AI-generated medical insights.

Implemented multi-turn conversation support, enabling the chatbot to remember context across interactions.

üñ• Interactive UI & Visualization
Built a Streamlit-based UI for user-friendly interaction with the medical chatbot.

Integrated real-time visualization of retrieved medical data, improving response clarity.

Designed an interactive chatbot interface with text and voice-based query support.

Enabled dynamic result filtering, allowing users to refine search results based on categories (e.g., symptoms, treatments).

Developed a patient history tracker, allowing users to view previous interactions and recommended treatments.

üöÄ Performance Optimization & Security
Optimized database queries with query caching and asynchronous processing to ensure real-time responses.

Implemented end-to-end encryption for secure data transmission and compliance with healthcare privacy regulations.

Followed OWASP security best practices, preventing SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and data breaches.

Designed API rate limiting mechanisms to prevent misuse and ensure stable performance.

Developed automated logging and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time system health tracking.
