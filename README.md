🚑 Medical RAG System – AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant
🛠 Backend & API Development
✅ Developed a Django REST API for structured medical knowledge retrieval, ensuring fast and scalable responses.
✅ Integrated FAISS-based vector search for high-speed retrieval of relevant medical documents.
✅ Designed an optimized PostgreSQL schema to store structured health records and knowledge graph data.
✅ Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure access management (patients, doctors, admins).
✅ Built ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load diverse medical datasets for efficient processing.

🔍 AI & Semantic Search
✅ FAISS-based semantic search enables rapid retrieval of relevant medical documents and articles.
✅ BM25 and TF-IDF ranking models improve search precision for keyword-based medical queries.
✅ Fine-tuned Qwen2-0.5B LLM for generating context-aware, accurate medical responses.
✅ All-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model enhances vector-based similarity search for healthcare data.
✅ Hybrid search system combines FAISS vector search with SQL indexing for optimized query performance.

📊 Medical Query Processing & Knowledge Graphs
✅ Integrated structured medical knowledge graphs to enhance AI-generated responses with factual accuracy.
✅ Named Entity Recognition (NER) extracts key medical terms from patient queries for better understanding.
✅ Multi-turn conversational AI enables chatbot memory, maintaining context across user interactions.
✅ Designed an explanation module, providing citations and references for AI-generated medical insights.
✅ Implemented disease-symptom mapping, allowing intelligent diagnosis suggestions based on user inputs.

🖥 Interactive UI & Data Visualization
✅ Built a Streamlit-based UI, offering an intuitive interface for user interaction with the medical chatbot.
✅ Implemented real-time visualization of retrieved medical data to improve response clarity.
✅ Developed an interactive chatbot UI supporting both text-based and voice-based queries.
✅ Added dynamic filtering, allowing users to refine search results by symptoms, treatments, or medications.
✅ Designed a patient history tracker, enabling users to review past conversations and AI recommendations.

🚀 Performance Optimization & Security
✅ Optimized query caching and asynchronous task processing for real-time medical data retrieval.
✅ Implemented end-to-end encryption (HTTPS & JWT authentication) for secure data transmission.
✅ Followed OWASP best practices, preventing SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and data breaches.
✅ Designed API rate limiting to prevent misuse and ensure stable system performance.
✅ Integrated Prometheus and Grafana monitoring, offering real-time tracking of system health and response times.
